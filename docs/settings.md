# Settings

In Bloxbind 1.1.0 additional settings were added to enable more features and customization.

## Options
Currently two main setting groups exist: Auto Verification and Naming Scheme.

### Auto Verification
- Automatic verification will verify users automatically when they join the server (if enabled).
- When enabled the bot will assign the configured verification role and optionally rename the user (see [Naming Scheme](/settings/#naming-scheme)).

### Naming Scheme
- The naming scheme currently supports a fixed set of options
  - Varibles: 
      - {RobloxUsername}
      - {RobloxDisplay}
      - {DiscordUsername}
  - Symbols:
      - @
      - \#
      - ( )
      - " "
      - ' '
